  var details = $("<div id='paragraphs'><p>Welcome!</p><p>We’re thrilled you’ve decided to use Tribe and our other products and services, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.”</p><p>We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. So please read them carefully.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don&#39;t use the Services.</p><p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p><p>1. Who Can Use the Services</p><p>No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.</p><p>By using the Services, you state that:</p><ol><li>You can form a binding contract with Snap Inc.</li><li>You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction—meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.</li><li>You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</li></ol><p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the Amendment to Tribe’s Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.</p><p>2. Rights We Grant You</p><p>Tribe grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.</p><p>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.</p><p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</p><p>3. Rights You Grant Us</p><p>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.</p><p>For all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant Snap Inc. and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.</p><p>Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.</p><p>For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site.</p><p>While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.</p><p>The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Tribe letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.</p><p>We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.</p><p>4. The Content of Others</p><p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Snap Inc. reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</p><p>Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</p><p>5. Privacy</p><p>Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that Tribe can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy.</p><p>6. Respecting Other People’s Rights</p><p>Tribe respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services in a manner that:</p><ol><li>violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.</li><li>bullies, harasses, or intimidates.</li><li>defames.</li><li>spams or solicits our users.</li></ol><p>You must also respect Tribe’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:</p><ol><li>use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.</li><li>copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.</li><li>use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.</li></ol><p>In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.</p><p>7. Respecting Copyright</p><p>Tribe honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Snap Inc. becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user’s account.</p><p>We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please contact us.</p><p>8. Safety</p><p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</p><ul><li>You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.</li><li>You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user’s information.</li><li>You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent.</li><li>You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.</li><li>You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.</li><li>You will not solicit login credentials from another user.</li><li>You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.</li><li>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.</li><li>You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.</li><li>You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.</li><li>You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.</li><li>We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap.</li></ul><p>9. Your Account</p><p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Tribe account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</p><ul><li>You will not create more than one account for yourself.</li><li>You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.</li><li>You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Live, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written permission.</li><li>You will not share your password.</li><li>You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.</li><li>If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Snapchat Support.</li></ul><p>11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</p><p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</p><p>If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.</p><p>12. Third-Party Services</p><p>If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Snap Inc. is not responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.</p><p>13. Modifying the Services and Termination</p><p>We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</p><p>While we hope you remain a lifelong Tribe user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.</p><p>Tribe may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p><p>Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Inc. continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13-22 of the Terms.</p><p>14. Indemnity</p><p>You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tribe, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.</p><p>15. Disclaimers</p><p>We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.</p><p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE SNAP INC. ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.</p><p>TRIBE TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH TRIBE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.</p><p>16. Limitation of Liability</p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIBE. AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF TRIBE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL TRIBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TRIBE, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.</p><p>17. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</p><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND TRIBE TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p><p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Tribe agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Tribe are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.</p><p>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p><p>Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Tribe, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Snap Inc. will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Tribe will pay that forum’s fees as well.</p><p>Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap Inc. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Tribe.</p><p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap Inc. are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap Inc. over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</p><p>Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</p><p>Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap Inc. can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Tribe in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Tribe username and the email address you used to set up your Tribe account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to us.</p><p>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Tribe may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p>Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Tribe.</p><p>18. Exclusive Venue</p><p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Tribe to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Tribe agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Tribe consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p><p>19. Choice of Law</p><p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.</p><p>20. Severability</p><p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p><p>21. Additional Terms for Specific Services</p><p>Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.</p><p>22. Final Terms</p><ul><li>These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire agreement between you and Tribe, and supersede any prior agreements.</li><li>These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</li><li>If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</li><li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li><li>You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</li></ul><p>Tribe welcomes comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions. Please send us feedback.</p><p>May 25, 2017</p></div>")

    $('#paragraphs').append("<p>This Amendment to Snap Inc.'s Terms of Service (“Terms”) is an agreement between Tribe and the U.S. Government and it applies to use of Tribe Services, including the Tribe app, by the U.S. Government.</p><p>The reason for this Amendment is that each U.S. Government entity (“you” or “Agency”) must follow Federal laws, regulations, rules, and practices when entering into a binding agreement, such as the Terms offered by Tribe at https://www.tribeapp.com/terms. This Amendment allows Agencies to use Tribe Services under Federal-compatible terms that respect each Agency’s legal status, its public mission, and other circumstances unique to the U.S. Government.</p><p>A. Government entity: As applied to U.S. Government users, the words “you” and “your” within the Terms refer to the Agency itself and do not apply to nor bind the individuals who use the Services on the Agency's behalf. Instead Tribe will look solely to the Agency as the party it will pursue if Tribe believes there’s been a violation or breach of the Terms.</p><p>B. Advertisements: Neither Tribe nor the Agency wants the Government’s content to be confused with other content. To minimize that risk, Tribe will not insert commercial advertisements or solicitations within an Agency’s own Story.</p><p>C. No endorsements: Tribe agrees that your Agency name, seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that you use the Services and Products will not be used by Tribe in such a manner as to state or imply that Tribe’s services and products are endorsed, sponsored, or recommended by the Agency or by any other entity of the Federal Government, or are considered by those entities to be superior to other available products or services. Except for areas whose content is under the control of the Agency, or for links to or promotion of such areas or content, Tribe agrees not to display any Agency or Government seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on its homepage or elsewhere on its Site unless permission to do has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant Federal Government authority. Snap Inc. may list the Agency’s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage, in promotional materials, or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third party name.</p><p>D. Indemnification, liability, statute of limitations, governing law, and forum: While the title of this section looks complicated, the rule Tribe and the Agency will follow is simple. We agree that any provisions in the Terms related to legal subjects will apply to Agency usage only to the extent consistent with Federal law. By way of examples, this means:</p><p>All indemnity and limitation-of-damages provisions in the Terms are waived.</p><p>Liability of Agency for any breach of the Terms as modified by this Amendment, or any claim arising from the Terms as modified by this Amendment, will be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Contract Disputes Act (if Agency is using a paid Service), or other governing federal authority.</p><p>The Arbitration, Class Waiver, and Jury Waiver provisions in the Terms are deleted in their entirety.</p><p>The Forum and Venue provision is deleted in its entirety. A lawsuit, if any, by the Agency or Snap Inc. against the other will occur in a federal tribunal.</p><p>The Choice of Law provision is deleted in its entirety. The Terms as modified by this Amendment will be governed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the federal laws of the United States.</p><p>E. Access and use: Tribe understands that the Agency’s use of Tribe and other Tribe Services may energize significant citizen engagement and otherwise become important to your public mission. Language in the Terms allowing Tribe to terminate your right to use the Services is modified to allow termination only if the Agency breaches its obligations under the Terms, if it fails to comply with instructions and guidelines posted on the Site, or if Tribe ceases to operate its Services generally. Tribe will provide the Agency with notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure any identified breach or failure, unless Tribe, in its discretion, determines that it must terminate immediately to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of Tribe, its users, or others.</p><p>F. Provision on crawlers: Any provision in the Terms prohibiting “crawler,” “spider,” or similar processes is amended to allow the Agency to apply such tools solely to gather its own content, and solely to fulfill the Agency’s obligations under the Federal Records Act or other applicable Federal law or regulation.</p><p>G. Modifications of Agency content: The right that Tribe reserves to use the Agency’s content and do the things Tribe needs to do to provide its Services in all media and distribution methods does not include the right to substantively edit or otherwise alter the meaning of the Agency’s content. In the event the Agency discovers that Agency content has been modified in a manner that alters its meaning, the Agency may contact Tribe and the parties will work together in good faith to resolve the matter.</p><p>H. No business relationship created: The parties are independent entities and nothing in the Terms as modified by this Amendment creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employer/employee relationship.</p><p>I. Paid services and Agency obligation: This Amendment applies to the Agency’s use of free as well as premium, enterprise, subscription, or other fee-based services or products that Tribe may offer. The parties understand that fee-based products and services are different than those that are free because paid services used by the Agency are subject to Federal procurement rules and processes. Before an Agency decides to enter into a paid or fee-based service that Tribe or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, it is the Agency’s responsibility to: (a) determine it has a need for those services, (b) consider the service’s value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere, (c) make sure funds are available for payment, (d) properly use the Government Purchase Card if that Card is used as the payment method, (e) review the Terms applicable at the time of ordering for its conformance to Federal procurement law, and (f) in all other respects follow applicable Federal acquisition laws, regulations, and Agency guidelines when initiating that separate action.</p><p>J. Federal records: The Agency acknowledges that use of Tribe’s Site and Services may require management of Federal records. Agency and user-generated content such as comments may meet the definition of Federal records as determined by the Agency. If Tribe holds Federal records, the Agency must manage Federal records in accordance with all applicable records management laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chs. 21, 29, 31, 33), and regulations of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B. Managing the records includes, but is not limited to, secure storage, retrievability, and proper disposition of all Federal records including transfer of permanently valuable records to NARA in a format and manner acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer. It is the Agency that is responsible for complying with applicable records management laws and regulations through the period the Agency is using the Site and Services.</p><p>K. Precedence; further amendment: Language in the Terms indicating the Terms alone make up the entire agreement between the parties is waived, as this Amendment applies as well. If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Terms, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules, or policies related to its Services, then this Amendment will prevail. Any modification to this Amendment must be agreed to by both parties.</p><p>May 25, 2017</p>")

    $('#paragraphs').append("<p>When you use our services—and any others we in the Tribe corporate family roll out, whether in the Tribe app or elsewhere—you’ll share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.</p><p>That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.</p><p>One final point before we dive in: We’re happy to report that we participate in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, which you can read more about here.</p><p>Information We Collect</p><p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p><ul><li>Information you choose to give us.</li><li>Information we get when you use our services.</li><li>Information we get from third parties.</li></ul><p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p><p>Information You Choose to Give Us</p><p>When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Tribe account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p><p>Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as Snaps and Chats to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send Tribe stickers, Chats, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Tribe as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.</p><p>It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Tribe Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.</p><p>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</p><p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Tribe stickers to friends. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p><p>Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:</p><ul><li>how you interact with the services, such as which stickers you view or apply to messages or which search queries you submit.</li><li>how you communicate with other Tribe users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</li><li>Content Information. We collect information about the content you provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</li><li>Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</li><li>Device Phonebook. Because Tribe is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook.</li><li>Camera and Photos. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</li><li>Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li><li>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please check out our Cookie Statement. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.</li><li>Log Information. We also collect log information when you use our website. That information includes, among other things:</li><li>details about how you’ve used our services.</li><li>device information, such as your web browser type and language.</li><li>access times.</li><li>pages viewed.</li><li>IP address.</li><li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.</li><li>pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</li></ul><p>Information We Collect from Third Parties</p><p>We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information we collect through our services.</p><p>How We Use Information</p><p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. Here are some of the ways we do that:</p><ul><li>develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.</li><li>send you communications, including by email. For example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</li><li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li><li>personalize the services by, among other things, customizing the content we show you, including ads.</li><li>contextualize your experience by, among other things, content using your precise location data (if, of course, you’ve consented to us collecting that data) and applying other labels based on the content.</li><li>improve ad targeting and measurement, including through the use of your precise location data (again, if you’ve consented to us collecting that data). See the Control Over Your Information section below for more information about Tribe’s advertising practices and your choices.</li><li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li><li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li><li>use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them.</li><li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies.</li><li>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.</li></ul><p>How We Share Information</p><p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p><ul><li>With other Tribe users.</li><li>information about how you have interacted with the services, such as your Tribe “score,” and other information that will help Tribe understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Tribe friends in common.</li><li>any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook.</li><li>With all Tribe users, our business partners, and the general public. We may share the following information with all Tribe usersas well as with our business partners and the general public:</li><li>public information like your name, username, Tribe score and sticker usage.</li><li>any content that you submit to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service. If a Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public at large or rebroadcast by our business partners.</li><li>With our affiliates. We may share information with entities within the Tribe family of companies.</li><li>With third parties. We may share your information with the following third parties:</li><li>With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.</li><li>With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:</li><li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li><li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li><li>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others.</li><li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li><li>With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Snap Inc. gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li><li>We may also share with third parties—such as advertisers—aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.</li></ul><p>Third-Party Content and Integrations</p><p>The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or offer a co-branded or third-party-branded service. Through these links, third-party integrations, and co-branded or third-party-branded services, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.</p><p>Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</p><p>We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on our services. These companies may collect information about how you use our services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.</p><p>Additionally, some companies may use information collected on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. For more information about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, go here.</p><p>Control over Your Information</p><p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p><p>Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request.</p><p>Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</p><p>Account Deletion. While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong Tribe, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here. If you ask to delete your account, you will have up to 30 days to restore your account before we delete your information from our servers. During this period, your account will not be visible to other Tribe users.</p><p>Advertising Preferences. We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests. If you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these ads, go here to learn about the choices available to you.</p><p>Users Outside the United States</p><p>Although we welcome Tribe from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, your information may be shared within the Tribe family of companies. This means that we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live.</p><p>Children</p><p>Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.</p><p>Revisions to the Privacy Policy</p><p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).</p><p>May 25, 2017</p>")

    $('#paragraphs').append("<p>Welcome!</p><p>We’re thrilled you’ve decided to use Tribe and our other products and services, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.”</p><p>We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. So please read them carefully.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don&#39;t use the Services.</p><p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p><p>1. Who Can Use the Services</p><p>No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.</p><p>By using the Services, you state that:</p><ol><li>You can form a binding contract with Snap Inc.</li><li>You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction—meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.</li><li>You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</li></ol><p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the Amendment to Tribe’s Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.</p><p>2. Rights We Grant You</p><p>Tribe grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.</p><p>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.</p><p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</p><p>3. Rights You Grant Us</p><p>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.</p><p>For all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant Snap Inc. and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.</p><p>Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.</p><p>For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site.</p><p>While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.</p><p>The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Tribe letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.</p><p>We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.</p><p>4. The Content of Others</p><p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Snap Inc. reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</p><p>Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</p><p>5. Privacy</p><p>Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that Tribe can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy.</p><p>6. Respecting Other People’s Rights</p><p>Tribe respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services in a manner that:</p><ol><li>violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.</li><li>bullies, harasses, or intimidates.</li><li>defames.</li><li>spams or solicits our users.</li></ol><p>You must also respect Tribe’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:</p><ol><li>use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.</li><li>copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.</li><li>use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.</li></ol><p>In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.</p><p>7. Respecting Copyright</p><p>Tribe honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Snap Inc. becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user’s account.</p><p>We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please contact us.</p><p>8. Safety</p><p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</p><ul><li>You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.</li><li>You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user’s information.</li><li>You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent.</li><li>You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.</li><li>You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.</li><li>You will not solicit login credentials from another user.</li><li>You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.</li><li>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.</li><li>You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.</li><li>You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.</li><li>You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.</li><li>We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap.</li></ul><p>9. Your Account</p><p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Tribe account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</p><ul><li>You will not create more than one account for yourself.</li><li>You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.</li><li>You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Live, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written permission.</li><li>You will not share your password.</li><li>You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.</li><li>If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Snapchat Support.</li></ul><p>11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</p><p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</p><p>If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.</p><p>12. Third-Party Services</p><p>If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Snap Inc. is not responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.</p><p>13. Modifying the Services and Termination</p><p>We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</p><p>While we hope you remain a lifelong Tribe user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.</p><p>Tribe may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p><p>Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Inc. continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13-22 of the Terms.</p><p>14. Indemnity</p><p>You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tribe, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.</p><p>15. Disclaimers</p><p>We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.</p><p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE SNAP INC. ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.</p><p>TRIBE TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH TRIBE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.</p><p>16. Limitation of Liability</p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIBE. AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF TRIBE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL TRIBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TRIBE, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.</p><p>17. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</p><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND TRIBE TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p><p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Tribe agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Tribe are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.</p><p>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p><p>Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Tribe, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Snap Inc. will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Tribe will pay that forum’s fees as well.</p><p>Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap Inc. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Tribe.</p><p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap Inc. are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap Inc. over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</p><p>Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</p><p>Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap Inc. can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Tribe in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Tribe username and the email address you used to set up your Tribe account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to us.</p><p>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Tribe may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p>Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Tribe.</p><p>18. Exclusive Venue</p><p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Tribe to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Tribe agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Tribe consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p><p>19. Choice of Law</p><p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.</p><p>20. Severability</p><p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p><p>21. Additional Terms for Specific Services</p><p>Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.</p><p>22. Final Terms</p><ul><li>These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire agreement between you and Tribe, and supersede any prior agreements.</li><li>These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</li><li>If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</li><li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li><li>You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</li></ul><p>Tribe welcomes comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions. Please send us feedback.</p><p>May 25, 2017</p>")
